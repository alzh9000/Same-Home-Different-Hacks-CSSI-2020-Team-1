# Same Home Different Hacks: Daince
Submitted for the "Educational" track. It also can be considered for the "Best use of Google Cloud" since it uses Firebase and "Best Domain Name".

## Inspiration
Dance is a beautiful art form and many people want to learn it. The dance studio industry has been steadily growing but some cannot take advantage of that. Videos are a wonderful tool but it cannot correct dance technique or posture. Our team wanted to create a platform that not only shows how to do the moves but measures and corrects dance movements. By using AI, we help people improve their dance moves.

## What it does
DAINCE uses artificial intelligence to detect people’s dance moves. It evaluates and tracks how a person is dancing compared to how the dance should be performed, so users of DAINCE learn how to dance better and assess their progress in learning dances. 

## How I built it
First, we established the tasks and order of priorities needed to complete the project. After making a simple wireframe, coding foundations were laid while a mockup was created.

## Challenges we ran into
Challenge 1

Challenge 2

Challenge 3 - Because of our diverse set of skills, it was initially difficult for us to divy up the tasks we needed to accomplish in order to build DAINCE. However, by working together and playing to each others’ strengths, we were able to work on the areas that we were the most well suited for, and thus succeed as a team. 

Challenge 4 - As a remote group, we had to work through merging issues on Github, real-time partner coding software, and varying timezones. Still, even though we have never met, we managed to create something beautiful together. 

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We are exceptionally proud of how our project can better teach people dance. 

## What we learned
