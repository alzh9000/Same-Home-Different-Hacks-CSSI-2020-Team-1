# Same Home Different Hacks: Daince
Submitted for the "Educational" track. It also can be considered for the "Best use of Google Cloud" since it uses Firebase and "Best Domain Name".

## Inspiration
Dance is a beautiful art form and many people want to learn it, as shown by the growing number of dance studios. With our new physically-distanced world, we can no longer take advantage of that. Learning dance moves from videos is a wonderful tool but, videos cannot tell you if you are doing a dance move correctly. We want people to experience the benefits of a real-life coach while keeping the convenience of video.


## What it does
DAINCE uses artificial intelligence to detect people’s dance moves. It evaluates and tracks how a person is dancing compared to how the dance should be performed, so users of DAINCE learn how to dance better and assess their progress in learning dances.

## How I built it
First, we established the tasks and order of priorities needed to complete the project. After making a simple wireframe, coding foundations were laid while a mockup was created. Once the mockup was finished, HTML and CSS developed it. Meanwhile, the backend team worked on retrieving videos and a list of timestamp markers. Tutorial videos loop according to the timestamps and those markers can be skipped, ignored, and replayed. Feedback from a webcam is taken and used to display a live score. The score is calculated by comparing the data from the webcam to the data from the original/professional dance video.


## Challenges we ran into
Challenge 1 -

Challenge 2 -

Challenge 3 - Because of our diverse set of skills, it was initially difficult for us to divy up the tasks we needed to accomplish in order to build DAINCE. However, by working together and playing to each others’ strengths, we were able to work on the areas that we were the most well suited for, and thus succeed as a team.
Challenge 4 - As a remote group, we had to work through merging issues on Github, real-time partner coding software, and varying timezones. Still, even though we have never met, we managed to create something beautiful together.


## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We are exceptionally proud of how our project can better teach people dance.

Our awesome web designer created a fantastic web mockup that we translated into real-life. Then we took it even farther and added beautiful micro-interactions. Subtle CSS transitions were added to most elements. If there was a user interface award in this hackathon, we are confident that we’d be strong contenders.

Also, taking live video of someone’s body and comparing their body positions real-time to videos is an exceptionally difficult challenge that we conquered.


## What we learned
Since each person worked on different things. People learned and improved on different skills. For example, the web developers learned how to create CSS animations and use JQuery to show/hide different elements. People who worked on the backend learned the trials of working with Postnet and improved their skills with Firebase. Others improved on their AI programming skills.

## What's next for DAINCE?
Daince is the next phase of dance instruction. From the data we glean from our user’s dance moves, we can develop their own custom dance plan which improves their weak points. With the same data, it can choreograph a dance using their strengths and moves they have already learned.
